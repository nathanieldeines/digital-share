## Transcriptions "R" Us

### Instructions
1. First, navigate to the [Transcription Form](https://goo.gl/forms/TgYfZ24YAeS0HpcH3).

2. The form is embedded with the facsimiles you'll be transcribing but it's easier with transcription box and image side-by-side. To do this, simply open [Hedley Finton's letter](http://hdl.handle.net/10020/860525_d166) and [Kate Greenaway's letter](http://hdl.handle.net/10020/860525_d202), resize and arrange the windows to create a side-by-side view.

3. Submit your form. Your transcriptions are automatically processed with R.

4. Ask Nathaniel about the results.

### That's it!
