### About This Demonstration
Hello Sharers! *Transcriptions "R" Us* is a demonstration of **just one possible way to process crowdsourced transcriptions** into usable data. This is **not meant for general users**. This is **something special we whipped up just for you Digital Sharers**  to provide a window into some of the more interesting aspects of crowdsourcing transcriptions, as well as reveal some of the issues and questions this method provokes.


### Instructions
1. First, navigate to the [Transcription Form](https://goo.gl/forms/TgYfZ24YAeS0HpcH3).

2. The form is embedded with the facsimiles you'll be transcribing but it's easier with transcription box and image side-by-side. To have it that way, simply open [Hedley Finton's letter](http://hdl.handle.net/10020/860525_d166) and [Kate Greenaway's letter](http://hdl.handle.net/10020/860525_d202), resize and arrange the windows to create a side-by-side view.

3. Submit your form. Your transcriptions will be processed with R automatically.

4. Ask Nathaniel about the results.

### That's it! Thanks for ~~being a guinea pig~~ participating!
