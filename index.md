**Hello Sharers! Transcriptions "R" Us is a demonstration of one way to process crowdsourced transcriptions into usable data. This is not meant for general users, but rather to reveal some of the (hopefully) interesting aspects of this method.**


### Instructions
1. First, navigate to the [Transcription Form](https://goo.gl/forms/TgYfZ24YAeS0HpcH3).

2. The form is embedded with the facsimiles you'll be transcribing but it's easier with transcription box and image side-by-side. To have it that way, simply open [Hedley Finton's letter](http://hdl.handle.net/10020/860525_d166) and [Kate Greenaway's letter](http://hdl.handle.net/10020/860525_d202), resize and arrange the windows to create a side-by-side view.

3. Submit your form. Your transcriptions are automatically processed with R.

4. Ask Nathaniel about the results.

### That's it! Thanks for ~~being a guinea pig~~ participating!
